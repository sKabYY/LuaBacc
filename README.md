LuaBacc (IN PROCESS)
=======

A Lua binder. Similar to LuaBridge.

The meaning of "bacc": 
*maybe "b" means binding, "bac" is the shortcut of bachelor (If you meet a chinese bachelor, just say "Lua" to him and then you will be friends), and "cc" means C++. On the other hand, "bacc" is pronounced like "idiot" in japanese. I hope LuaBridge will be easy to use even if the user is an idiot XD. Anyways, finally, "bacc" means nothing but being fun ^ n^.*
